For working with relative line numbers, there is a good plugin:[ Relative Line Numbers ](https://github.com/nadavspi/obsidian-relative-line-numbers). 

However, in its basic implementation, the relative line numbers appeared in the second column next to the absolute numbers.

Fortunately, you can use [this successful fork](https://github.com/hezeao/obsidian-relativenumber).
And although the fork already has some implementation of highlighting, you can override it via CSS: [relativeLine_css](../../custom%20CSS/text%20editor/relativeLine_css.md)
