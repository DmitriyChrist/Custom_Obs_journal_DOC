The navigation methods discussed here are purely demonstrative at this point. Unfortunately, stable behavior has not yet been achieved.The approaches considered here primarily work well only with [Horizontal tab layout](../../custom%20CSS/user%20interface/tabOverview/Customizing%20TabOverview%20Tabs.md#horizontal-tab-layout)

By default, tabs remain fixed and selection is performed by tapping the desired tab.Two additional navigation approaches are available:
-  [Single-step navigation](#single-step-navigation): Swiping left/right moves to the adjacent tab
- [Center-based navigation](#center-based-navigation): Swiping left/right activates the tab closest to center
