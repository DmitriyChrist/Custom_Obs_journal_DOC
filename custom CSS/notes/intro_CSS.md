Customization of Obsidian through CSS is one of the fastest and safest ways to enhance your workflow in Obsidian.

For working with CSS snippets, I highly recommend using the [CSS editor](https://github.com/Zachatoo/obsidian-css-editor) plugin, as it allows you to modify, edit, and extend existing code snippets on the fly.

For some CSS snippets, the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin may also be required.
